    <h1>Weekly Project Post Week 2</h1>

    <p>
        Last week I spent time focusing on what my goals were for the project and explored a few different directions. 
        I broke the idea into features and now I just need to decide which takes priority and which are needed to submit a quality project.

    <p>
        This week I plan to work on the website front page and explore how I want to structure the project as a website. 
        A big part of my project is managing and creating data, since I want to be able to edit and move variables around 
        depending on project information as I'm leaning towards creating a project management tool. I've been wanting to 
        play around with SQL so I think I'll familiarize myself with the basics.

        Looking back I could have pushed myself further by doing more than just outlining the proposal. 
        I'm mentally still in break mood and it's been a struggle to fully shift back to focusing on classes.

    <h1>Weekly Project Post Week 3</h1>
    
    <p>
        Last week I worked on setting up the overall structure of the website. I built out the sidebar layout, which 
        shows the main features I want the project to have and will be how users navigate through the app. The Projects 
        page is functional but still blank for now, and the Weekly Reports page works as a simple page to display these 
        updates.
    </p>

    <p>
        I also started working on the SQL database. The main focus has been setting up tables to store project 
        information, since projects are the largest piece of data in the system. From there, projects will eventually 
        have child data like tasks. I also added tables for users and clients. I mostly experimented on my own, but I 
        did look up some layout and icon ideas to speed things up instead of rebuilding everything from scratch. I also 
        finally settled on a name for the website to make the project feel a little more real.

        What do I plan to do this week?
    </h2>
    <p>
        This week I plan to focus on the Projects tab and getting actual data to show up there. The first goal is to let
        users view a list of projects pulled from the database. The data will be pretty minimal at first, but it should 
        help me practice connecting the UI to SQL and working with different data inputs. Once that’s working, I want 
        to start letting users edit project information through the UI.

        TLooking back, I think I spent a bit too much time focusing on how the front end looks instead of how everything 
        works underneath. I enjoy working on the UI, but I don’t want to run into situations where I have to redo designs 
        because the implementation changes. Moving forward, I want to focus more on getting the backend and data flow 
        solid first, and then come back and polish the UI once things are more stable.
